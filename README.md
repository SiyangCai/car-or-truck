# Car or Truck?

This is a well-known classification problem in deep learning. I'm going to use convolutional neural network to build a deep learning model to help classify the sample [car-or-truck dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanholbrook/car-or-truck).

## Dataset
This dataset has been split into training and validation files. In both files, they are manually classified into cars and trucks. It is very common that
